# "Your pet" project

**Hello everyone!**

Greetings from the students of the Fullstack course at GoIT IT-professional school!

We are delighted to present to you our graduation project developed by GoIT students upon completing the React and Node.js course.

**"Your pet"** â€” is an online pet search platform that provides a quick and easy way to find a pet among a large volume of ads.

Users can browse ads for pets that are available for sale or give away for free, as well as for found or lost pets. Registered users can post their own ads, add interesting ads to the selected list.

In the personal account, registered users can update and edit personal information that will be displayed in their ads. Users can also upload photos of their pets to their own page.
